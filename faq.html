		<p><details><summary>Where do I download MODFLOW?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>There are several different versions of MODFLOW available. <p><a href="https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/index.html">Click here for your version.</a></p>
		</p></div>
		</details></p>
		<p><details><summary>How do I install MODFLOW?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>Download the installation file from the MODFLOW web page. If the file is an '.exe' file, double-click it. When the dialogue box appears, select 'unzip.' If the file is an '.zip' file instead, just unnzip it.</p></div>
		</details></p>
		<p><details><summary>How do I run MODFLOW on Windows?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
			<p>Open a command line window.  On Windows XP, you do this by first clicking the Windows "Start" button in the lower left and selecting "Run..." then type "cmd" and click the OK button.  In the command line window, use the "cd" command to change to the directory to the directory that contains the name file for your model. If you also have a copy of MODFLOW in the same directory as your input files, type the the name of the MODFLOW executable. If you don't have a copy of MODFLOW in the same directory as your input files, type the full path for MODFLOW. MODFLOW will start and prompt you for the name of the name file. Type the name of the name file and press 'enter.'</p>
			<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
			<p>Create a text file in the same directory as the input files for the model. On the first line of the file enter the full path for MODFLOW such as "C:\Wrdapp\mf2k.1_18\bin\mf2k.exe" followed by a space and then the name of the name file.  On the second line write the line "pause".</p></div>

	<p><details><summary>How do I edit MODFLOW files?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>MODFLOW is a command-line program rather than a graphical user interface program.  All the input for MODFLOW must be prepared in advance in a text editor or a separate graphical user interface.</p></div>
		</details></p>
	<p><details><summary>How do I read binary files?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>Some programs that can read data from binary files generated by MODFLOW include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hydpost (included with MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005)</li>
				<li>ZoneBudget</li>
				<li>MODPATH</li>
				<li>GW_Chart</li>
				<li>MODFLOW-GUI</li>
				<li>ModelMuse</li>
				<li>MFBIN2RASTER and CBC2RASTER</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>Note that the binary files must be an unstructured non-formatted file to be read by the above programs. To generate such files with versions of MODFLOW not distributed by the USGS, openspec.inc in the MODFLOW source code may need to be modified prior to compiling MODFLOW. In addition, Graphical User Interface programs for MODFLOW may be able to read such binary files.

		</details></p>
		<p><details><summary>Where can I find example input files?</summary>
			<div class="faq_content"><p>Example input files are included with MODFLOW.  They are in the "data" folder for MODFLOW-2000 or the "test-run" folder for MODFLOW-2005</p></div>

	<p><details><summary>Why does my model take so long to run?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>There are a number of things you can do to make MODFLOW run faster without changing the simulated values.
			<ul>
				<li>Limit the amount of data that is printed or saved.
					<ul>
						<li>When reading data with the Array Reading Utility Modules, set IPRN to a negative number to prevent the array from being printed to the listing file.
						</li>
						<li>Use the Output Control Option to limit what output data is printed or saved.
						</li>
						<li>Many packages have options similar to IWELCB in the Well Package that allow you to suppress saving the computed flux term.</li>
						<li>Many packages, such as the Well Package have a NOPRINT option that can be used to suppress printing of the input data.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If your model is using virtual memory when running, adding more memory can speed up the model.
				</li>
				<li>MODFLOW prints lots of data to the listing file so sometimes printing that data can be a bottleneck in the model. Using a faster storage medium such as a solid-state drive instead of a hard drive can help.</li>
				<li>A faster processor can help.
				</li>
				<li>A computer with multiple processors can help if you will be running other programs at the same time as MODFLOW.</li>
				<li>Modify the source code of MODFLOW to make it a multiple-treaded application.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><details><summary>Why is my model stopping when the output files get too large?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>If the disk on which the files are being written is formatted as FAT or FAT32, the maximum allowed file size is 4 GB minus 1 byte. Larger files can be created if the file system in NTFS.</p></div>
		</details></p>
		<p><details><summary>Why am I getting an error message stating I'm "out of virtual memory"?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>"Virtual memory" is used when your computer does not have enough physical memory to run the model so some data that would normally be in memory is saved in the hard drive instead. You need to have enough hard drive space to store the extra data. Another reason you might get this message is that you are running a 32-bit version of MODFLOW and the model requires more than 4 gigabytes of memory. If that is the case, you need to run a 64-bit version of MODFLOW. There are 64-bit versions of MODFLOW-NWT and MODFLOW-OWHM distributed by the USGS.</p></div>
		</details></p>
		<p><details><summary>Why won't my model converge?</summary>
		<div class="faq_content"><p>The convergence criteria such as HCLOSE and RCLOSE in the PCG2 package may be too strict or the number of iterations in the solver may be too small. Adjusting other parameters of the selected solver or changing to a different solver may also be helpful.  For large models, the GMG solver can prove helpful.</p>

		<p>If the solver has the capability of printing out additional information about the solution process such as by setting IPRPCG to 1 in the PCG2 package, it can be worthwhile to examine the solution information to gain insight into what is causing the problem.</p>
		
		<p>Use of the wetting capability can result in non-unique solutions because the head in a cell must be higher than some wetting threshold. If a cell starts off wet, it can remain active even if the head drops below the wetting threshold. However, if it starts out dry, it may not be wetted because the head in the neighboring cells may be too low. Use of the wetting capability can cause serious problems with convergence.</p></div>
